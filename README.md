    # Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction
This project is a sentiment analysis model trained on Amazon reviews using the RoBERTa model from the Transformers library in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Usage
To use this sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Python script for sentiment analysis:
    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- Transformers
- PyTorch
- numpy
- pandas
<!-- Add more if necessary -->

## Model
The sentiment analysis model is based on the RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach) architecture, which is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. RoBERTa is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and fine-tuned on the Amazon reviews dataset for sentiment analysis.
